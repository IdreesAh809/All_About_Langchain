      "Summary: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\n",
      "Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
      "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Recent versions, such as Python 3.13, 3.12 and older (and 3.14), have added capabilities and keywords for typing (and more; e.g. increasing speed); helping with (optional) static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported.\n",
      "Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and it has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: History of Python\n",
      "Summary: The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum was Python's principal author and had a central role in deciding the direction of Python (as reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)) until stepping down as leader on July 12, 2018. Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collector, reference counting, memory management and support for Unicode, along with a change to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.\n",
      "Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features were also backported to the backwards-compatible Python versions 2.6 and 2.7 until support for Python 2 finally ceased at the beginning of 2020. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\n",
      "As of 9 August 2025, Python 3.13.6 is the latest stable release. This version currently receives full bug-fix and security updates, while Python 3.12—released in October 2023—had active bug-fix support only until April 2025, and since then only security fixes.

      "Summary: The syntax of computer source code is code structured and ordered restricted to computer language rules. Like a natural language, a computer language (i.e. a programming language) defines the syntax that is valid for that language. A syntax error occurs when syntactically invalid source code is processed by an tool such as a compiler or interpreter. \n",
      "The most commonly used languages are text-based with syntax based on strings. Alternatively, the syntax of a visual programming language is based on relationships between graphical elements.\n",
      "When designing syntax, a designer of any language might start by writing down examples of both legal and illegal strings, before trying to figure out the general rules from those examples in use. Such that its general structure of syntax can be determined through its form of composition, so to yield semantically valid ranges everytime for each possible alteration. Or else, it returns errors, and warnings, for each invalid input. \n",

      "Page: Syntax error\n",
      "Summary: A syntax error is a mismatch in the syntax of data input to a computer system that requires a specific syntax. For source code in a programming language, a compiler detects syntax errors before the software is run; at compile-time, whereas an interpreter detects syntax errors at run-time. A syntax error can occur based on syntax rules other than those defined by a programming language. For example, typing an invalid equation into a calculator (an interpreter) is a syntax error.\n",
      "Some errors that occur during the translation of source code may be considered syntax errors by some but not by others. For example, some say that an uninitialized variable in Java is a syntax error, but others disagree – classifying it as a static semantic error.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Recent versions, such as Python 3.13, 3.12 and older (and 3.14), have added capabilities and keywords for typing (and more; e.g. increasing speed); helping with (optional) static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported.\n",

      "Summary: The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum was Python's principal author and had a central role in deciding the direction of Python (as reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)) until stepping down as leader on July 12, 2018. Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collector, reference counting, memory management and support for Unicode, along with a change to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.\n",
      "Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features were also backported to the backwards-compatible Python versions 2.6 and 2.7 until support for Python 2 finally ceased at the beginning of 2020. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\n",
