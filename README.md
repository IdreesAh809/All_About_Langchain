#  LangChain — Complete Practical Implementation

This repository is my **complete, from-scratch implementation** of LangChain — covering every concept, component, and integration needed to build modern **LLM-powered applications**.  
It includes experiments with **different vector databases, models, and tools** to fully understand how LangChain connects all parts of a generative AI pipeline.

---

##  Objective

To deeply learn and implement:
- All **core LangChain modules**
- Integration with **multiple LLM models**
- Use of **different embeddings and vector stores**
- Development of **retrieval-based and agent-based applications**
- Step-by-step experiments to master every LangChain concept
