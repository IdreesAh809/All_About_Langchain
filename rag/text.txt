"Speech-to-text" is technology that converts spoken words into written text. It is also known as speech recognition, voice typing, or dictation, and is used in a variety of devices and services like virtual assistants, transcription tools, and search engines. 
How speech-to-text works
Speech recognition is a complex process that relies on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and computational linguistics to interpret spoken language. 
Audio analysis: The process begins when a microphone captures audio input.
Digitization: The system converts the sound waves into a digital format that the software can process.
Signal processing: Background noise is filtered out, and the speech signal's characteristics, like pitch and volume, are adjusted.
Acoustic modeling: The system analyzes the digital signal and breaks it into smaller units of sound, called phonemes. It uses an acoustic model trained on audio data to map these phonemes to their likely text representations.
Language modeling: The system applies a language model to predict the most probable word sequences based on the linguistic context. This helps distinguish between similar-sounding words, such as "weather" and "whether".
Text generation: The system decodes the phonetic and linguistic data to produce a text transcript of the spoken words.
Post-processing: Advanced systems can further refine the text by adding punctuation, correcting errors, and identifying different speakers (speaker diarization). 
Everyday applications
Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa take voice commands to perform tasks such as answering questions, setting reminders, and controlling smart home devices.
Dictation software is used in word processors and other applications, allowing you to type with your voice instead of your keyboard.
Transcription services use speech-to-text to automatically convert meetings, interviews, and other audio recordings into text, which improves accessibility and record-keeping.
Voice search allows you to perform web searches on your phone or computer using spoken queries.
Accessibility tools provide closed captions for videos and assist individuals with physical limitations to interact with computers. 
Accuracy
The accuracy of speech-to-text has improved dramatically with advancements in AI. While earlier systems were limited, modern technology can handle natural speech, various accents, and multiple languages with high precision. Accuracy can be affected by factors such as audio quality, background noise, and the complexity of the spoken language.
